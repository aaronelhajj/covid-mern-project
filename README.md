COVID-19 project
My COVID-19 Project is working on being a helpful tool for people looking to find statistics on how COVID is affecting the world with data being pulled
from reliable third party API's. Users will be able to create secure accounts and store the data of countries after filling out a small form with reason of intent.
I'm currently still working on implementing a few features first being hosting it on a server so anyone can check it out! Secondly, I plan to implement a filter feature
based on alphabetical names, or by highest to lowest cases depending on what the users is interested in.
As of tomorrow (8/31/2022) I will be creating a video of how the project functions in the meantime while I work on getting it on the web.
